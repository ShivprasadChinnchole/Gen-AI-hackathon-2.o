What you've experienced: "${entry}"
Emotional responses identified: ${emotions.join(', ')}
Current intensity level: ${intensity}/10
${contextText}

From a clinical perspective, I want to first normalize that your emotional responses to this situation are understandable and valid. When individuals experience difficult events, a range of emotional reactions is expected and healthy.

**Immediate Safety Assessment:**

${emotions.includes('hopeless') || emotions.includes('suicidal') || intensity >= 8 ?
  "Your responses indicate a high level of distress that requires immediate attention. I strongly recommend connecting with crisis support services: National Suicide Prevention: 1800-599-0019 (24/7), or presenting to your nearest emergency department for immediate evaluation. You deserve immediate professional support." :
emotions.includes('depressed') || emotions.includes('sad') && intensity >= 6 ?
  "The emotional intensity you're experiencing suggests you could benefit from additional professional support. Mental Health Crisis Line: 1075 provides immediate assistance and can help connect you with appropriate resources." :
"While you're experiencing significant distress, your ability to engage in this reflection suggests some level of emotional regulation capacity."}

**Clinical Observations and Interventions:**

${emotions.includes('anxious') || emotions.includes('panic') || emotions.includes('scared') ? 
  "Your anxiety responses are physiological reactions to perceived threat. Evidence-based grounding techniques may help: Progressive muscle relaxation, 5-4-3-2-1 sensory grounding (5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste), and controlled breathing exercises can help regulate your nervous system." :
emotions.includes('angry') || emotions.includes('rage') || emotions.includes('frustrated') ?
  "Anger often serves as a protective emotion signaling boundary violations or unmet needs. Consider implementing a 'time-out' strategy before responding to triggers. Physical movement and journaling can help process these emotions constructively." :
emotions.includes('sad') || emotions.includes('depressed') ?
  "Your grief responses are natural reactions to loss or disappointment. Self-compassion practices and maintaining basic self-care routines (nutrition, sleep, hygiene) become particularly important during these periods." :
"Your emotional responses appear within normal parameters for someone processing this type of experience."}

**Professional Recommendations:**

• **Immediate Safety**: Ensure you have access to crisis resources and a safety plan
• **Support Network**: Activate appropriate social supports while maintaining healthy boundaries  
• **Self-Care Protocol**: Maintain basic needs (sleep, nutrition, medical care)
• **Professional Follow-up**: Consider scheduling with a licensed therapist for ongoing support

This is not your fault - you are the victim of a crime." :

**Therapeutic Framework Moving Forward:**
This appears to be a situation that could benefit from evidence-based therapeutic approaches. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or trauma-informed care may be particularly helpful depending on the specific nature of your experiences.

IMPORTANT: Respond as this specific Indian family member would naturally speak. Don't sound formal or therapeutic. Use their real personality, vocabulary, and way of giving advice.

DO NOT use any markdown formatting like **bold** or *italic* or any asterisks. Just write plain text suggestions that sound natural and conversational.

Return exactly 4-6 practical suggestions, each on a new line starting with a dash (-).`;
